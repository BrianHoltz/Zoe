        "A mixture of Conway's LIFE and Core Wars. Each organism has a
        genetic program which controls its behavior. The program has all
        the normal types of instructions you would expect from a
        programming language: flow control, arithmetic, subroutines, and
        so on. But, there are also special primitives for interacting

      <li>"All KFORTH programs are compiled into a tabular
        representation. Each element of the table is either a number or
        an instruction. Each row is called a "code block". The first row
        is special because this is where execution always starts. A
        KFORTH program begins executing at (0, 0) (code block 0, program
        counter 0). If the table element contains a number, it is pushed
        on the data stack, otherwise the instruction is executed."</li>
      <li>"Mutations operate on this tabular structure. A simple
        mutation is to pick two random entries and swap them. Or two
        random rows can be swapped. etc...&nbsp; Any weird and wacky
        random transformation to this table will result in valid KFORTH
        program. During sexual reproduction two genetic programs are

        <li>this is not a game about evolution. The creatures will
          certainly be able to evolve in a pretty sophisticated way
          (perhaps even the most sophisticated way ever tried), but in
          practice it’s not the primary focus of the game. Natural
          selection is VERY SLOW, and the time it takes is proportional
          to both the complexity of the creatures that are evolving and
          their life span. For these creatures to live long enough for
          you to get to know them and care about them means that they

          Artificial Life 13, p.139) with sensory-motor capabilities

          and compete for its resources. In this implementation they
          reproduce asexually, and the genome that codes for its
          morphology and behavior (via the neural network that controls
          its motions) undergoes mutations during reproduction. The
          world in which the creatures live is a three- dimensional,
          physically simulated environment where energy resources are
          continuously replenished, decay, and eventually absorbed by
          foragers. Creatures die if their energy is depleted, and are
          born from a parent that has accumulated enough energy to
          reproduce. There is no explicit fitness function in this
          system; however since poor foragers quickly die out, we
          witness a strong selective pressure to pass on genes for
          increasingly sophisticated foraging behavior to the
          offspring."</li>

          <li>"We demonstrate artificial evolution in a system that
            combines physical simulation with competition between
            creatures. The simulated creatures are constructed using
            point masses that are connected by oscillating springs. The
            creatures pull them-selves across their 2D environment by
            varying the amount of friction at different point masses,
            giving them sticky feet. Creatures combat one another, and
            the victor of such an en- counter earns the right to
            reproduce, possibly with mutation. Rather than testing one
            individual against another in pairs, as many as 100
            creatures move and interact with each other in the same 2D
            environment. Over time, the initial creatures are replaced
            by new creatures that are more agile and better at combating
            others. The evolved creatures from such simulations exhibit
            a wide array of body plans, locomotion styles, and
            interaction behaviors."</li>

    <ul>
      <li>We hand-coded Vulture and Algae species, but the Vulture
        species spawned a mutant that is more algae-like than our Algae
        species.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Another Vulture mutant lost its Gene sequence for fleeing from
        living organisms, with the result that when two of them
        encounter each other they freeze and in effect set up a colony.<br>
