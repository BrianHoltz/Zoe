    Zoe: organisms that hunt, mate, reproduce, and evolve under the
    control of algorithms that mutate.<br>
    <h2>Features</h2>
    In Zoe, organisms ("bugs") are simulated creatures that<br>
    <ul>
      <li>feel and see nearby objects,</li>
      <li>turn and move toward or away from sensed objects,<br>
      </li>
      <li>get energy from sunlight or from objects they bite,</li>
      <li>sense physical and genetic attributes of themselves and of
        nearby bugs,</li>
      <li>think and act by executing "genes": subroutines running in the
        bug's virtual machine, and</li>
      <li>mate, reproduce, and evolve through mutation and sexual
        recombination of these genes.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Behavior, Not Structure</h2>
    Zoe bugs have no physical or structural attributes, and instead only
    have functional attributes like position, heading, size, energy
    level, memory, and sensory data.&nbsp; Each gene of a bug is a
    When/Do pair of programs in a Turing-complete language called Zoel.
    Each gene executes on a separate thread in the virtual machine for
    each bug.&nbsp; The genome of a species is a priority-ordered list
    of genes, and higher-priority genes can interrupt lower-priority
    genes if their When program evaluates to true.&nbsp; Genes are
    sometimes deleted, reordered, or mutated during asexual
    reproduction, resulting in a new species. If the parent mated before
    giving birth, then the child gets half its genes from each parent,
    also creating a new species. Thus evolution in Zoe modifies the
    behavior of bugs, not their structure or appearance. (However, each
    species has a distinct color in the Zoe graphical view, and mutant
    species are randomly assigned a color slightly different from that
    of the mother's species.)<br>
    <h2>Energy and the Zoel VM<br>
    </h2>
    The resources in a Zoe world are energy, plus execution time and
    memory space in each bug's Zoel virtual machine.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Energy enters Zoe through constant sunlight that every bug
        automatically absorbs, and through randomly-generated simple
        bugs that drift spontaneously into the world. Energy leaves Zoe
        by bug locomotion and by inefficiency in eating and reproducing.
      </li>
      <li>During each cycle of a Zoe world, each living bug gets a turn
        to execute its genome. Its turn continues until the bug executes
        1) an operation that costs energy or 2) the maximum per-turn
        number of energy-free operations.</li>
      <li>Each Zoe bug has a private call stack and data stack for each
        of its genes, and an associative heap that is shared by all its
        genes. The sizes of these data structures are limited as a
        function of the bug's size. When the limits are reached, the
        oldest elements drop off the bottom of the stack or are removed
        from the heap.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Zoel Genotype</h2>
    A Zoel genotype is a priority-ordered list of genes. A gene is a <i>When/Do</i>
    pair of programs written in Zoel. The <i>When</i> programs are
    evaluated in order, to find the highest-priority gene whose <i>When</i>
    evaluates to true. That gene's <i>Do</i> program is then executed.<br>
    <br>
    A Zoel program is a list of expressions. An expression can be an
    operation, a value, or another list of expressions. An operation
    specifies an operator and an optional operand. An operator operates
    on one or both of its optional operand and the top element of the
    data stack.&nbsp; Operands and stack elements may be string literals
    or floating point numbers. Operands (but not stack elements) may
    also be:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>a reference to a "hardware register" (bug attribute)</li>
      <li>a reference to a stack element (keyed by integer depth)</li>
      <li>a reference to a heap value (keyed by any literal)</li>
      <li>a list of expressions<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
